### Final Project Presentation

The final project presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ONTWxiroiyFwvuNOl-OR4MwDbW_tOyORVgBZgQgaM3U/edit?usp=sharing)

### Code Structure

The code is organized as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── project_code.py
├── project.ipynb
├── requirements.txt
├── LICENSE
└── references
    ├── Lab9.ipynb
    └── lab15_code.py
```

To run all the code, you can simply run the Jupyter notebook `project.ipynb`. This notebook contains code in addition to explanations for each part. The code is also available in the Python script `project_code.py`.
